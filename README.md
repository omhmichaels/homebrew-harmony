## History
 This repository was originally created for the Harmony Bounty here: 
- https://github.com/harmony-blockchain/bounties/issues/69

The bounty specifications ask for a Cask. The reasoning for this is believed to be the following:
- Harmony would like to have the package installed directly from thier stable binary releases of there code. 
- Harmony prefers this method over building from source
- Harmony believes binary installation is the best way to onboard people to Harmony Blockchain
- Simplifies installation dependencies compared to building from source. 

*The bounty also mention bottles but does not mention formulea.*
